index_demo.html and SDSC_playground.js are included for demonstration purposes only: SDSC_playground.js is generating random colors for all cells except "HAM.SDSC.EDU", "DOUGH.SDSC.EDU", "XIGUA.SDSC.EDU", "YOLK.SDSC.EDU", and "ZUCCHINI.SDSC.EDU". Useful for project presentation and general proof of concept.

The files that are neccessary to run the webpage properly are currently: 'perfect.js', 'YJ_index.html', 'YJ_bootstrap.css', and 'YJ_custom-styles.css'.

Screen Shot... and background image... files exist so that the webpage can display these images through the internet; not locally.
